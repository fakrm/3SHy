            <h2>System Overview</h2>
            <p>This Python-based web server implements a secure user authentication system with database integration. It handles user registration with email verification, login validation, and serves an energy data dashboard interface. Built using Python's <span class="highlight">http.server</span> module and <span class="highlight">MySQL</span> for database management, the system provides a complete solution for secure access to energy consumption data.</p>
            
            <p>The server implements a two-step registration process for enhanced security. When users sign up, their information isn't immediately stored in the database. Instead, a unique verification token is generated and an email with a verification link is sent to the provided address. Only after clicking this link (which confirms ownership of the email) is the user's information added to the database with a verified status. This approach significantly reduces the risk of fake accounts and ensures data integrity.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Secure Email Verification</h3>
                <p>Implements token-based email verification with 24-hour expiration to ensure legitimate user registrations and prevent automated account creation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>MySQL Database Integration</h3>
                <p>Securely stores user credentials and verification status in a MySQL database with proper password handling.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Dynamic Data Generation</h3>
                <p>Upon successful login, generates a JavaScript file containing database information to power the energy dashboard interface.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Comprehensive HTTP Handling</h3>
                <p>Manages different types of HTTP requests through dedicated methods for POST and GET requests with proper error handling.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Dashboard Integration</h3>
                <p>Provides data for an interactive dashboard that displays energy consumption with filtering and visualization options.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>The server handles different types of HTTP requests through its specialized methods:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>POST requests:</strong> Handle form submissions for signup and login processes</li>
                <li><strong>GET requests:</strong> Manage page navigation, resource loading, and email verification</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The verification system stores tokens in memory (which would be replaced by database storage in a production environment) with a 24-hour expiration period. This provides a reasonable timeframe for users to complete verification while maintaining security.</p>
            
            <p>Upon successful login, the server queries all database tables and formats the data into a JavaScript object that powers the dashboard interface. This allows users to interact with energy data through tables and charts, filtering by date and searching for specific information.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Dashboard Functionality</h2>
            <p>Once logged in, users can access the Energy Data Dashboard that provides multiple ways to analyze energy consumption data:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>15-Minute Intervals:</strong> View granular energy usage patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Data:</strong> Examine consumption trends by day</li>
                <li><strong>Average By Date:</strong> Analyze average consumption over time periods</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The dashboard includes search functionality and date filters to help users focus on specific time periods or data points of interest. All information is presented both in tabular format and through interactive charts for improved data visualization.</p>
